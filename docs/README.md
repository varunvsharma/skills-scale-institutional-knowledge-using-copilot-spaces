# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — Overview & Index

## About These Docs

This repository centralizes OctoAcme's project management processes to enable rapid onboarding, ensure consistent practices, and retain team knowledge. The processes are based on clear roles, iterative delivery, risk management, and a culture of continuous improvement.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery that emphasizes clear ownership, data-informed decisions, and psychological safety. Each project is structured around well-defined phases—from initiation through retrospective—with dedicated roles including Project Managers (who coordinate delivery, schedules, and risk), Product Managers (who define outcomes and prioritize the backlog), Developers (who implement and collaborate on design), and QA/Testing teams (who validate quality). This approach ensures that cross-functional teams can deliver product features, services, and integrations efficiently while maintaining high quality standards.

Key workflows include establishing a project charter and roadmap during initiation, breaking down work into sprint backlogs during planning, and using daily standups and PR-driven execution to track progress. Communication strategies are built around regular cadences—weekly PM/PdM syncs, twice-weekly team standups, and monthly stakeholder updates—complemented by ad-hoc escalations when needed. The team maintains transparency through project boards, risk registers, and clear acceptance criteria, ensuring all stakeholders remain aligned throughout the project lifecycle.

Quality assurance is embedded throughout the process via comprehensive testing practices, code reviews, and a checklist-driven release process with rollback and incident playbooks. Each project concludes with a structured retrospective that captures learnings and drives actionable improvements, fostering a culture of continuous enhancement. These practices are supported by clear documentation of roles and personas, ensuring that every team member understands their responsibilities and how they contribute to successful project outcomes.

The OctoAcme project management framework prioritizes small, testable increments that deliver customer value quickly while maintaining flexibility to adapt based on metrics and feedback. By combining structured processes with collaborative practices and a commitment to learning, OctoAcme enables teams to deliver reliably, reduce cycle time from idea to production, and maintain high standards of code quality and observability across all projects.

## How to Use These Docs

These process documents are living resources designed to guide project teams and facilitate knowledge sharing across OctoAcme. Keep your Project Charter updated in the project repository, and consider adding process-specific documentation to `.copilot/` directories when you want GitHub Copilot Spaces to use them as context.

**To propose updates or additions to these process docs:** Use the [Add/Update Process Documentation issue template](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/add-update-content-to-process-docs.yml) to request changes. This helps maintain consistency, captures rationale for updates, and ensures stakeholder review when needed.
